# How Opvizor compares to others.

Most of the solutions usually require an agent to operate. On one side a custom agent brings wider functionaly and therefore more rich results where on the other side it can be quite complex to setup at some point.

In Opvizor many integrations work without the need of agent installation. Here are listed some of them:
- VMware vSphere
- NetApp
- Microsoft SQL
- Oracle
- PostgreSQL
- Dell PowerMax
- Cisco UCS
- Cisco Switches
- Brocade Switches
