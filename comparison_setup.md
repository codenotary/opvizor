# Ease of setup
Usually monitoring solitons require to go though a setup wizard which can be quite long and even complex. Mistakes can happend and you may need to re-iterate once again before you get to the right configuration. This is never the case with Opvizor.

We always aim to put ourselves in our customer shoes therefore we understand that a significant amount of products that are out there are dropped after you struggle with the setup for more than 30 minutes.

Opvizor's rapid deployment allows to finish with the setup within 5 minutes and see your essential data on dashboards right after.

We ship OVA template that can be easily imported in your vSphere environment. No need for any complex configurations up on the way.

Here are a few straight forward steps to get the Opvizor installed:
