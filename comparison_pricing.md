# Pricing

Eeach solution offers different and various features so prioritize what you truly need!

Think about how your infrastructure will grow ahead, consider future scaling and cost implications

Opvizor encourages to take a free trial for as long as 30 days so you can test drive it fully before committing.

Here's a simplified breakdown of the pricing models for each monitoring solution, along with a comparison to help you make a decision:

## Netdata
**Summary**: A free tier for basics, paid tiers focused on the number of nodes monitored with more features for collaboration across teams.
**Verdict**: Excellent for cost-conscious monitoring, especially for smaller setups.

## Dynatrace
**Summary**: Pay-as-you-go based on usage, various feature tiers. Can be complex for simple needs.
**Verdict**: Powerful and scalable, but potentially higher cost for extensive use.

## Instana
**Summary**: Priced per host, focused on application and infrastructure monitoring together.
**Verdict**: Solid choice for unified monitoring, can be costlier for larger deployments.

## Datadog
**Summary**: Pricing based on various metrics (hosts, logs, custom metrics). Flexible but requires careful planning to manage costs.
**Verdict**: Versatile for various use cases, good if you need multiple metric types tracked.

## Opvizor
**Summary**: Subscription-based, focused on VMware vSphere environments. Pricing scales with the number of ESXi hosts and features.
Verdict: Specialized, good for optimizing vSphere, might be less suitable for diverse environments.

## Verdict: Which Is Right for You?

Small setups, limited budget: Netdata's free tier or Opvizor's starter plan could work well.
Large-scale, diverse needs: Dynatrace or Datadog provide maximum flexibility but might involve greater cost.
Unified app and infrastructure monitoring: Instana is a solid contender.
VMware-specific focus: Opvizor excels in this area while providing a ton of other enterprise level integrations.
